                 <h2 class="cross">Cross Country</h2>   
                 <p >I've been running cross country since 6th grade. Cross Country is a very time consuming and a large commmitment. The practices are 5-6 days a week. If you don't have practice 6 days a week you run on your own. The key to cross country is consistency. You can't gain endurance and become a better athlete if you don't have consistency in the sport. Cross Country is very fun because there's a lot of group work with your team. I've been running cross country for four seasons and will continue to play through the rest of high school at lane tech.</p>

                    <p>Along with cross country, I've been running track since since sixth grade. Track and cross country have similar tasks of consistency. I am a long distance runner so my events in track are the 1600 or the 1 mile. My other event is the 3200 or the two mile. This year at lane is my first indoor track season. I will run outdoor track in the spring. Track is a huge team sport, esspecialy when it comes to events like relays.</p>

                    <p>Irish dance has been my main sports for my entire life. I've been doing dance for 12 years. Irish dance is not as large as a commitment. I have pracitces two days a week. I have competitions whenever I choose too. The goal in Irish dance is to make it worlds and win. There are multiple levels to Irish dance. Irish dance is very much how you present yourself. Irish dance is not a team sport and is mainley focused on how you dance as an individual.</p>
